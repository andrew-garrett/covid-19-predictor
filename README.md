# covid-19-predictor
This is a machine learning model which served as my final project in ENM360, instructed by Dr. Paris Perdikaris and PhD Candidate Georgios Kissas (both g.o.a.t.s in their own right).  The project utilizes important packages such as JAX, Pandas, and MatPlotLib.  Using COVID-19 tracking data from each of the 50 US states, we use an MLP architecture to perform Bayesian regression in order to characterize and functionalize important parameters (infection, recovery, and mortality rates).  Then, using the SIRD ODE system, we are able to model the system analytically with a high degree of accuracy.  Next, this analytical data is used as validation for an LSTM predictor.  Hyperparameter selection for the LSTM was extremely difficult.  Although this project was not overly accurate in its final results, the process was bountiful in lessons taught about coding with machine learning architectures.
